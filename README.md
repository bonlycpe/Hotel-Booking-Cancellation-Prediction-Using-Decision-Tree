# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree

### The Machine Learning project on Data Warehouse and Data Mining Class. 

→ Develop and study an Random Forest Classifier Model to create a classification model that can predict the likelihood of bookings being canceled.   
→ In this project, we made a Random Forest Classifier Model using a dataset sourced from the "Hotel booking demand datasets" paper, which consists of 32 variables.   
→ We performed preprocessing and model optimization, and in the final evaluation, we achieved an accuracy of 0.94.
